## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application called Employee Tracker that that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. This is a command-line application from scratch to manage a "company's" employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL:

When I start the application I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When I choose to view all departments I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids. When I choose to view all roles I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role. When I choose to view all employees I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When I choose to add a department I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database. When I choose to add a role I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database. When I choose to add an employee I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. When I choose to update an employee role I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
